## Erik's gitconfig

I am constantly copying alias and git configuration between machines, and I never remember all of it. So I'm going to stash it here for easy reference, and distribution.

Feel free to suggest any cool aliases or new configuration that would be useful to me :)

Drop this in your global config which can be found with:

`git config --global --list --show-origin`
